# The First Article I Could Find
## What is Software Engineering?
[article from michigan technological university](https://www.mtu.edu/cs/undergraduate/software/what/#:~:text=Software%20engineering%20is%20the%20branch,software%20solutions%20for%20end%20users.)
What I found interesting about this article was that it didn't seem to emphasize the concepts we've gone over in class. I understand that it is just a brief summary, but I've found that the argument for workfolow organization in software engineering pretty compelling, but most of these skills get mentioned under "other soft skills" that would be beneficial for software engineers, while coding and other hard skills are more enphasized.
